As I was developping Themis further on, Cerema teams requested the integration of window opening/closing sensors into the system, 
in connection with their work on indoor air quality.
Measuring indoor air quality without knowing whether windows are open or closed makes little sense.

A first test was done with the Sonoff DW1, which is actually rather a door alarm sensor that can detect the opening status.
The DW1 sensor is working with a SONOFF RF Bridge 433, which works as a Wifi/radio hub, using an ESP8285 microcontroller
